        <p>Sometimes on the ICW I wished that there was an easy way to find out what statute mile I was at.  This website aims to solve that simple need.</p>
        <p>Prior to this site, there is a fast way to find out approximately: search in Aqua Maps Master for the nearest 5-mile AICW data point.  There is also a slow way to find out exactly what mile you are at: find the nearest 5-mile mark on the chart and measure the distance from there.</p>
        <p>Now there is a way to find out accurately and quickly.</p>
