        <p>Sometimes on the ICW I wished that there was an easy way to find out what statute mile I was at.  This website aims to solve that simple need.</p>
        <p>Prior to this site, there was a fast way to find out approximately: search in Aqua Maps Master for the nearest 5-mile AICW data point.</p>
        <p>Now there is a way to quickly find that out more accurately.</p>
